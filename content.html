    Following on from our own successful MUN conference in January, fourteen Challoner’s delegates travelled to Merchant Taylors School to take part in its inaugural conference - MTSMUN.


Model United Nations (MUN) is essentially a form of debating, where delegates take on the role of various countries in specialised committees which resemble that of the United Nations. Students debate contemporary issues and write resolutions to draft solutions to some of the most pressing issues of our times: the Israel-Palestine conflict, climate change, the refugee crises - and other issues being discussed in the real UN right now.<br><br>

At MTSMUN, the committees discussed a wide range of issues, including the question of external debt sustainability, the future of antibiotics and the Iran-Iraq war in the Disarmament and International Security (DISEC) committees. The latter was particularly interesting as it was set in 1985, so delegates had to debate in an unfamiliar context. There was also a ‘crisis’ topic - a previously unseen situation which the committees have
to respond to. In this case, it was the fictitious development that Iran had blockaded the Straits of Hormuz and invaded Israel, having deployed chemical weapons against military targets there. With Israel threatening nuclear warfare it was certainly a difficult crisis to defuse.<br><br>


As the MTSMUN’s brilliant conference drew to a close, it was great to see two Challoner’s delegates (Chris Berry and Kit Haworth) win the Best Speaker award for their speeches in the Security Council and Economic and Financial Council respectively. The Challoner’s MUN Society now looks forward to the HABSMUN conference in March.<br><br>

Year 11 RS students were invited to visit the Al-Khoei Foundation, to aid their understanding of the Islamic aspect of the GCSE course.<br><br>

The Al-Khoei Foundation is a charity, headquartered in London, set up in 1989 by the late Grand Ayatullah Al-Khoei. It strives to cater for the needs of Muslim communities across the world
and runs schools in a multitude of countries including Canada, Thailand and India. The Foundation is vital in promoting interfaith and intrafaith dialogue in an effort to bridge divisions between different groups, as well as holding the General Consultative
Status at the UN. In London, the building is comprised of three major sections: the headquarters of the charity, the Islamic Centre and two schools which provide education to over 400 students.<br><br>

The day commenced in the Islamic Centre, where students were first treated to a fascinating discussion regarding Islamic Philosophy. Ideas including the existence of God and the soul were discussed, with the Imam of the mosque, Ayatollah Professor Fadhil H. Milani (who also happened
to be a renowned scholar) providing numerous arguments which we hadn’t thought about previously - such as the ‘necessary existence’ of God. We were surprised to hear the Imam appeared on television weekly across Europe! The work of the Al-Kawthar Project, which provides valuable help to orphans and widows
in Iraq, was also highlighted.<br><br>

A Q&A session followed, with Challoner’s students asking a variety of probing questions - including what the mosque thought about the actions of ISIS. The Imam responded by stating his repeated condemnation of the group, and saying he was one of the people who advocated
for news outlets such as the BBC to cease calling the group simply 'The Islamic State': because the group is ‘neither Islamic, nor a state’.<br><br>

After lunch, students were shown the headquarters of the charity. It was fascinating to observe pictures of the famous figures who had visited the Foundation, including Queen Elizabeth II and multiple world leaders. We were then treated to a talk from the Imam’s son, Jaffer Milani, who relayed the history of the mosque.
The building was formerly a synagogue, and it was shocking to learn the handmade Iranian rug inside the prayer hall was worth an estimated £5,000,000!<br><br>

The visit was undoubtedly exceptionally interesting, and will help us greatly with the Islamic sections in the GCSE exams. I would like to thank the teachers involved and particularly the Al-Khoei Foundation, who were tremendously welcoming and provided students with a memorable day.<br><br>

          As the Sixth Form debating society drew to a close for the academic year, four pairs of Year 12 students were selected to debate in the Oxford Union Society's annual schools' competition - the largest British Parliamentary school-level debating competition in the world.<br><br>

Hosted by Magdalen College School, the teams approached the challenge with apprehension and excitement. The format meant that there was only 15 minutes of preparation time after the motion was announced, with the teams taking the role of either the government or the opposition.<br><br>

The first motion was 'This house would ban violent video games’ and the government sides generally took the position that such games normalise violence, especially in young children. The opposition pointed to examples of people playing such games responsibly and questioned the ramifications of such a blanket ban economically and the precedent in terms of state involvement it seemed to set.<br><br>

The second debate proved trickier and much more controversial, with the motion 'This house would arm the police'. The government teams argued for this move, pointing to examples where a swift armed response could have prevented tragedy. However, the opposition teams argued against this 'need’ and noted how subconscious racial bias, among other factors, could potentially lead to loss of innocent life while also alienating the police from the average person.<br><br>

We all agreed it was a brilliant experience and would like to thank Mr Spencely for his continued help in preparing for the tournament and organising the weekly debating sessions.<br><br>

        Last Monday, Matthew Levine (Year 12) and I represented Challoner's in the English Speaking Union (ESU) Schools’ Mace, a prestigious debating competition and the oldest and largest one for schools in England.<br><br>

Given the motion ‘This house would ban the sale and consumption of meat’ almost a month in advance, which we were to be the proposition for against the Wycombe Abbey School, this was very different to other debating tournaments we had taken part in previously - where the motion is normally given as little as ten minutes before the start of the debate. We knew how notoriously difficult this competition was - only two Challoner’s teams have progressed from the first round in over a decade, but perhaps as a sign of the school’s increasing
debating prowess, these two teams both happened to achieve this feat in the past two years. Indeed, the team of Matt Cooke and James Wroe last year went further than any other Challoner’s team ever has - defeating national champions Eton College to reach the third round.<br><br>

Understandably apprehensive, this followed multiple intensive preparation sessions, in which we (along with the help of Mr Spenceley) meticulously refined our arguments and analysed all possible opposing points and conjured counter-arguments.<br><br>

I was up first during the debate, opening the case for our side. I focused primarily on the severe environmental repercussions of the meat industry and emphasized our collective responsibility for stewardship, while linking and extending this line of argument through highlighting the moral price of continuing to exploit animals for food - using the example of the chicken cull (where male baby chicks are sent through industrial grinders as they are not needed in egg production) as a particularly prominent example.<br><br>

In return there was a feisty opening opposition speech, in which the speaker brought up several points, including the extent to which the government can impose such restrictions on our eating habits. This was supplemented by several other smaller points - including the possibility of the creation of a black market and the regressive nature of such shifts as the poor are ostensibly hit hardest in a shift towards a vegetarian diet.<br><br>

These arguments were systematically deconstructed by a Matthew Levine speech, in which he rejected the suggestion government cannot limit our meat consumption by using the social contract argument, and using examples of other scenarios where the government limits certain freedoms for our good. He continued to use the opposition’s own argument of the Prohibition period, which they used to suggest there would be a black market, to argue the contrary was true by highlighting the differences between the two time periods. One of Matt’s points which was particularly well received by the judges was the argument that the development of non-meat alternatives essentially rendered the
consumption of meat unnecessary and therefore ludicrous when considering the detrimental externalities. A slightly weaker opposition speech followed, which focused mostly on the economic loss associated with the ban, before the debate opened to the floor and both sides were swamped with questions, which included some questionable ones, such as one directed to us which essentially tried to argue against the fact the UK was a democracy.<br><br>

We have the opportunity now to recognise our wrongdoing and face the future with courage, instead of clinging desperately to an immoral institution which we try to ignore. We have the opportunity… to be remembered as a society who was brave enough to do what was right, instead of what was accepted.<br><br>

Matthew Levine
The opposition summary speech followed, mostly recapping the opposition arguments, but it was Matt’s summary speech to conclude the debate which I think was the greatest sway factor for the judges. In a speech so inspiring our opposition themselves came to us to mention it, Matt, after consolidating our rebuttal points, went on to play with the audience's emotions as he asked what future generations would think of us if we were willing participants in an industry so damaging.<br><br>

As the debate ended, tension was high as the judges went to deliberate the result. Fifteen minutes passed. Then twenty. Nearly half an hour later the judges came back and announced Challoner’s the victors, which meant we progress to the regional finals of the competition. We await details of our opposition in the second round and are excited to see just how far we can progress.<br><br>
